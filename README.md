Then, the next page is the game screen, which shows three buttons.
These buttons let you choose your move: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Once you click one of them, the move counter will start.

This proves that the move counter is working correctly.

Once 10 moves are completed, you will be taken directly to the results screen.

If you start the game and directly click "View Result", it will show a draw because you didn't make any moves. Both you and the computer will have a score of 0.
